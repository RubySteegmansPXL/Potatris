# HOW TO USE THE SHAPE CREATOR MENU:

1. In Unity, on the top bar, there is now an additional button "Tetris". 
2. Click "Shape Creator".
3. A window will pop up. You may resize it or move it around.
4. At the top of the new window, you can load in an existing shape to edit.
    4a. Drag in or select (with the little circle on the right) a valid existing shape.
    4b. Click "Load Shape".
    4c. If the shape did not contain any errors and the loading was successfull, a message will pop up saying it was loaded.
5. On the main grid, you can define what the shape looks like.
    5a. A shape always needs a center piece. This is marked in green.
    5b. Segments that are part of the shape are gray.
    5c. Segments that are NOT part of the shape are black.
    5d. Click on a segment to make it active/inactive
        IMPORTANT: If there is no center piece, the next active segment you click on will be made the center piece instead of become inactive!
6. You have the option to select a different name for the shape
7. You can also choose to use an existing color palette, or create a new one
    7a. If you choose an existing palette, a window will appear where you can drag in a valid sprite data asset.
    7b. If you choose to create a new palette, three color fields will appear instead.
8. You can then choose if the shape is rotatable. 
9. Finally, hit the "Generate Shape" to create (or update) a shape!
    9a. When editing a shape, the file will be adjusted. No need to fix broken editor links!
    9b. When creating a new shape, this will happen in the Assets/TetrisShapes folder.
    9c. Any newly generated color palettes will be generated under the Assets/TetrisShapes/Colors folder.
10. If you hit the reset button, all current changes will be wiped and you can start over!
